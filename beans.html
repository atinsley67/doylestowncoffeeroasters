            <p>
                Ethiopian coffees are known for their bright, floral and fruity notes and this
                washed process coffee from Sidamo is no exception. We've found this coffee the perfect 
                blend of interesting, with Black Tea, Lemongrass and Apricot notes, and familar 
                with a satisfying full body.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like most coffee, this is a washed process coffee where the bean is removed from the fresh cherry before
                being washed and dried.
            </p>
            <p>
                We recommend this roasted to full city (medium) to give a balance between those interesting flavor notes
                and the roasty sweetness of a more developed coffee. However, this also comes out great in both
                lighter roasts for more emphasis on those flavor notes or darker for more emphasis
                on that roasty complexity.

            <h2>Brazil - Summer Solstace</h2>
            <h3>Daterra - Natural Process</h3>
            <img src="images/daterra-summer-solstice.png" alt="Daterra Estate" class="content-image">
            <p>
                This delicious coffee imidiately caught our attention when we tried it,
                with a remarkably clear, full, fruity body.
            </p>
            </p>
                Not only a natural (or dry) process coffee, where the bean is dried inside
                the coffee cherry before being extracted and processed, this coffee is
                dried on the coffee plant itself before harvest, and the result is evident.
            </p>
            <p>
                Roasted ligher, this bean really lets the fruit shine through but carries
                enough balance for an enjoyable cup. Roasted medium, fruity undertones are
                still present, but with more rounded caramel and cocoa.
            </p>
            <p>
                Must try!
